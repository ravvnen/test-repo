title: Idempotent Request Standard
content: |
  Unsafe (side-effecting) POST endpoints that create resources MUST support
  idempotency via an Idempotency-Key header. The server MUST return the same
  result for retried requests with identical key within a 24h window.
  Idempotency keys MUST be opaque and treated as secrets in transit only.
