title: Role-Based Authorization Standard

  Authorization MUST be enforced server-side using centralized policy (e.g. ABAC
  or RBAC service). Clients MUST NOT rely solely on hidden UI elements to prevent
  access. Authorization decisions MUST be auditable with subject, action,
  resource, decision, and timestamp.
