title: API Pagination Guideline
content: |
  Collection endpoints returning more than 50 items MUST implement pagination.
  Cursor-based pagination SHOULD be preferred over offset when ordering by
  non-unique or evolving fields. Responses MUST include:
    - items: array of results
    - page_info.next_cursor (nullable)
    - page_info.previous_cursor (nullable)
    - total_count (MAY be approximate for large datasets)
  Clients MUST NOT rely on stable ordering unless documented.
