title: API Versioning Standard
content: |
  Public APIs MUST be versioned using a prefix (e.g. /v1/) and MAY also support
  content negotiation via Accept header (e.g. application/vnd.company.v1+json).
  Breaking changes REQUIRE a new major version. Minor, backwards compatible
  additions MAY be added within the same major version.
  Sunset notices MUST be communicated at least 90 days prior to deprecation.
