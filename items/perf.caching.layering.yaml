title: Caching Layer Strategy
content: |
  Apply multi-layer caching where beneficial: in-memory (per instance) -> shared
  distributed cache -> CDN/edge. Cache keys MUST include all input dimensions.
  Stale-while-revalidate MAY be used for non-critical freshness. Sensitive or
  user-specific data MUST NOT be cached at shared layers.
